### About
- M3KB is maintained here for __my own personal use__. 
- LGPL is just inherited from its original work. No harm for user anyway. Subject to change if I decide to use some other tech to back the layout creation - _see below_. Generally speaking no serious stuff going here, all free for good!
- For Burmese, you may even decide to use the default input method comes with the OS. However, these default input methods are not usually affinity to the ___Smart___ feature that require for complex script like Burmese (why? give a skim through UTN#11).
- I always take keyboard layout is something personal preference. There are a bunch of way to make your own _personalized_ keyboard layout if you are tech-savvy a bit and, spare a day or two. For that, check the tech and standard section below for some pointers.
- For now, I adopt Keyman (again) because it is now [owned by SIL](https://keyman.com/sil-acquisition/) and announced that it is [going free](https://keyman.com/free/). Again, subject to change otherwise I feel another tech is cool!
- Bottom line, it is more for user focus. It is for me. I would want to spend the least minimum effort and time to have this. Best, if I don't even need to do this. But all avil are void to the way I wanted. So here I am making this happen. And share with you! One fine day in future, I guess, we won't need this. But not for now. So until then.

### Standard
- Unicode [X.X] Character Code Charts - mainly focus on [Myanmar Burmese](http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1000.pdf) (aka _Code Chart_)
  - [http://unicode.org/charts/](http://unicode.org/charts/)
- Unicode Technical Note #11 Representing Myanmar in Unicode: Details and Examples (aka _UTN#11_)
  - [http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn11/](http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn11/)

### Tech
- [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele) for Mac
- The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator - [_MSKLC_](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx)
- [Keyman](https://keyman.com/) - [_GitHub_](https://github.com/keymanapp)
- [NHM Writer](http://software.nhm.in/products/writer)
- [Keymagic](https://keymagic.net/) - [_GitHub_](https://github.com/thantthet/keymagic)
- [WaitZar](https://code.google.com/archive/p/waitzar/) - [_GitHub_](https://github.com/yathit/waitzar)
- [Ekaya](http://thanlwinsoft.github.io/www.thanlwinsoft.org/ThanLwinSoft/Ekaya/) - [_GitHub_](https://github.com/thanlwinsoft/ekaya)

_Ukelele and MSKLC are static layout mapping. The rest are featured specifically to solve the complex script input method requirement._
