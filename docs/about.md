### About
- M3KB is maintained here for my own personal use. 
- It is a bit overkill to use LGPL. It is just rather inherited from its original work. No harm for user anyway, so I adopt it. Subject to change if I decide to use some other tech to back my layout creation - _read below_. Generally speaking no serious stuff going here, all free for good!
- For Burmese, you may even decide to use what the default input method comes with the OS. However, these default input methods are not usually akin to ___Smart___ feature that require for complex script like Burmese.
- I always take keyboard layout is something personal preference. There are a bunch of way to make your own _personalized_ keyboard layout if you are a tech suvvy a bit and, spare a day or two. Here are some tech:
  - The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator - [_MSKLC_](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx)
  - [Keyman](https://keyman.com/) - [_GitHub_](https://github.com/keymanapp)
  - [NHM Writer](http://software.nhm.in/products/writer)
  - [Keymagic](https://keymagic.net/) - [_GitHub_](https://github.com/thantthet/keymagic)
  - [WaitZar](https://code.google.com/archive/p/waitzar/) - [_GitHub_](https://github.com/yathit/waitzar)
  - [Ekaya](http://thanlwinsoft.github.io/www.thanlwinsoft.org/ThanLwinSoft/Ekaya/) - [_GitHub_](https://github.com/thanlwinsoft/ekaya)
- Only MSKLC is static layout mapping. The rest are featured specifically to solve the complex script input method requirement.
- For now, I adopt Keyman (again) because it is now [owned by SIL](https://keyman.com/sil-acquisition/) and announced that it is [going free](https://keyman.com/free/). Again, subject to change otherwise.
- Bottom line, it is more for user focus. It is for me. I would want to spend the least minimum effort and time to have this. Best, if I don't even need to do this. But all avil are void to the way I wanted. So here I am making this happen. And share with you!
