### About
- M3KB is maintained here for __my own personal use__. 
- LGPL is just inherited from its original work.
- For Burmese, you may even decide to use the default input method comes with the OS. However, these default input methods are not usually affinity to the ___Smart___ feature that require for complex script like Burmese (why? give a skim through UTN#11).
- There are a couple of way to make your own _personalized_ keyboard layout if you are tech-savvy a bit and, spare a day or two. For that, check the tech and standard section below for some pointers.
- I adopt Keyman (again) because it is now [owned by SIL](https://keyman.com/sil-acquisition/) and announced that it is [going free](https://keyman.com/free/). Hope for the better outcome of future [SIL](https://www.sil.org/) Keyman, but subject to change otherwise I feel another tech is cool!
- I would want to spend the least minimum effort and time to have this. Best, if I don't even need to do this. One fine day in future, I guess, we won't need this. So until then.

### Standard
- Unicode [X.X] Character Code Charts - mainly focus on [Myanmar Burmese](http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1000.pdf) (aka _Code Chart_)
  - [http://unicode.org/charts/](http://unicode.org/charts/)
- Unicode Technical Note #11 Representing Myanmar in Unicode: Details and Examples (aka _UTN#11_)
  - [http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn11/](http://www.unicode.org/notes/tn11/)

_Ukelele and MSKLC are static layout mapping. The rest are featured specifically to solve the complex script input method requirement._
